Crypto Trader for small fluctuations in stable coins - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

This came about during my crypto crazy days when I realised that stablecoins always have an ever-so-small fluctuation against the currency that they are based on, and looking closely, at times, they even have a larger price difference amongst them.

This is my not so clever attempt of trying some sort of high frequency trading with a script that looks at a range of stablecoins and makes trades that would maximise profit taking into consideration trade prices.
