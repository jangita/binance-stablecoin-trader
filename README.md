# Stablecoin Trade Bot
Crypto Trader for small fluctuations in stable coins - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

This came about during my crypto crazy days when I realised that stablecoins always have an ever-so-small fluctuation against the currency that they are based on. On expanding this thought, the idea came to me about looking at not only the differences between the coins and their "base" currency, but the coins against other stablecoins and ... viola! The price difference is big enough to make a few cents per trade.

So, this is my not so clever attempt of trying to build a dumb bot that looks at a bunch of stablecoins and trades between them considering the price per trade. It is currently using the Binance API, although with time it can be made exchange agnostic.

It has NO AI at this point and just uses a simple set of rules.
